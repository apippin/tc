Getting and Installing

Downloading

   Can be downloaded from:
   http://github.com/apippin/3rd/downloads

   It can also be obtained via the GIT revision control system by pulling from here:
   (ssh)               git@github.com:apippin/3rd.git
   (http)              https://owenleonard@github.com/apippin/3rd.git
   (git - read-only)   git://github.com/apippin/3rd.git

Dependencies

   phpgroupware
   mysql
   apache (or equivalent webserver)
   MLS data dumps (required fields shown below)
   Python 2.6 or .Net 3.5 (for trimming MLS data dumps)

Installing

   1) Download the tgz or zip file and extract it or GIT pull the archive into 
      your base phpgroupware directory (like /usr/share/phpgroupware/).
   2) Setup the mysql table structures for the 3rd Counselor application:
      mysql -u <dbuser> -p <dbpass> < tc/sql/tc.sql
   3) Point your browser to: http://www.yourdomain.com/phpgroupware/setup 
      The setup prog will autodetect this application. From there you will 
      need to assign this app to the users you want to have be able to use it.
      Enable it for each user by going to Site Admin -> User Accounts -> <username> -> edit
      Make sure the "tc" application has a checkmark next to it under "Permissions this user has"
   4) Copy the setup/db_config to setup/db_config.local and change the values in .local appropriately. 
      Check for syntax errors by running eq/bin/check_config_syntax
   5) Copy the setup/tc_config to setup/tc_config.local and change the values in .local appropriately.
      Make sure you update the path locations for your specific installation locations: 
      upload_target_path & application_path
      Check for syntax errors by running tc/bin/check_config_syntax
   6) Try to run tc/bin/import_ward_data & parse_ward_data scripts from the commandline
      to check for any missing perl library dependencies and mysql connection. 
      Just run them without command line args.
      Install the right perl modules until the scripts run without any errors.
   7) A graphical representation of the mysql schema used by this application can 
      be found here: tc/sql/tc.jpg
   8) Run mls/mlstrimmer.py or MLSFileTrimmer.exe to trim down the csv files and combine them
      into a zip file.  If you run mls/mlstrimmer.py, you'll need to point it to 
      mls/windowsGUI/MLSFileTrimmer/MLSRequiredFields.xml.  If you choose to not use 
      EQ\ Prospective\ Elders.mls or Home\ Teacher\ per\ Companionship.mls, you'll need to 
      remove them from MLSRequiredFields.xml (probably best to just comment them out in case you
      decide to use them later)
   8) Click on the Admin tool in the 3rd Counselor app to import your initial set of ward data
      obtained from MLS.
   9) Click on the Admin tool and update the Presidency Table appropriately.
      The most important thing at this point is to get your district leaders added 
      for each district you have in your quorum.
  10) I highly recommend installing phpmyadmin to view/edit/debug mysql tables related to this tool.

Requirements

   The following csv files must be obtained from MLS (or a stripped down version
   of each csv with the fields indicated must be manually created). These files
   should be placed in 1 .zip file and uploaded to the application via the Admin
   section of the application.

   Membership.csv:
     Preferred Name
     Household Phone
     Indiv ID
     HofH ID

      Optional file that lists the prospective elders for which  the EQ has stewardship.
      Use this file if you want them listed in the PPI/attendence/etc lists
      import mls/EQ\ Prospective\ Elders.mls as a new report into MLS to create the csv file.

   Home Teacher per Companionship.csv  (optional file that lists home teaching stats - use all fields)
     import mls/Home\ Teacher\ per\ Companionship.mls as a new report into MLS to create the csv file.
